my name is Lasse K. Rasmussen I am a dedicated engineer with high professionalism who is passionate about technology and development. I have a Engineering Degree in Chemistry and Biotechnology. The program has given me a strong foundation of applied mathematics, statistics and the ability to build an overview over complex contexts. As a person, I am curious and see challenges as an opportunity to learn something new.
